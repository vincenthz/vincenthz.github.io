I'm currently living in Cambridge, UK.

My past work and interests leads me to work on various projects: the Linux kernel, OpenMosix,
Xen, XenServer, XenClient, Qemu, Bank trading application (Haskell), various cryptographic
projects.

More recently, I've been contracting through
[Typed IO](https://typed.io/) and I've been involved in many different projects involving
cryptography, security and engineering:

* Privacy enhanced e-mail with mediation
* Network traffic analysis in haskell
* Homomorphic and Database encryption in haskell
* Zero Knowledge Proofs in haskell
* Cryptography & Security audits
* Cryptocurrencies wallet clients and blockchain servers
