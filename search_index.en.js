some big changes on the tls package.\nI've finally manage to wrap it up in something that people can use straight out of hackage.\nState improvements§\n\nOne major limitation of previous tls versions, was that you wouldn't be able to\nread and write data at the same time, since all the state was behind a big-lock\nsingle mvar. Now the state is separated between multiple smaller states with\ncan be concurrently used:\n\nthe RX state for receiving data.\nthe TX state for sending data.\nthe handshake state for creating new security parameters to replace RX/TX state when the handshake is finished\nMisc state for other values.\n\nFor many protocols like HTTP, this was never an issue as the reading and\nwriting are disjoints. But some others protocols that do intertwined read and\nwrite (AMQP, IMAP, SMTP, ..) were rightfully having difficulties to use tls.\nThis provide a more scalable implementation, and optimise the structure changes\nto the minimum needed.\nCertificate improvements§\n\nThe second pharaonic change was a major rewrite of ASN.1, X509 and the handling\nof certificate. The support libraries are now splitted in more logical units, and\nprovide all the necessary foundations for a much simplified handling of\ncertificates.\nASN.1 that was previously all in asn1-data is splitted\ninto asn1-types for the high level ASN.1 Types,\nasn1-encoding for BER and DER binary encoding support,\nand asn1-parse to\nhelp with parsing ASN.1 representation into high level types. Generally,\nthe code is nicer and able to support more cases, and also more stress tested.\nCertificate certificate is splitted too and is now deprecated in favor of:\n\nx509: Contains all the format\nparser and writer for certificate, but also now support CRL. The code has\nbeen made more generic and better account certificate formats from the real\nworld.\nx509-store: Contains some\nroutines to store and access certificates on disk; this is not very different\nthan what was in certificate.\nx509-system: Contains all\nroutines to access system certificates, mainly the trusted CA certificates\nsupported. The code is not different from certificate\npackage, except there's now Windows supports for accessing the system\ncertificate store.\nx509-validation: One of\nthe main security aspect of the TLS stack, is certificate validation, which\nis a complicated and fiddly process. The main fiddly aspect is the many input\nvariables that need to be considered, combined with errata and extensions.\nThe reason to have it as a separate package it to make it easy to debug,\nwhile also isolating this very sensitive piece of code. The feature is\nmuch more configurable and tweakable.\n\nOn the TLS side, previous version was leaving the whole validation process to a\ncallback function. Now that we have a solid stack of validation and support for\nall main operating systems, tls now automatically provide the validation\nfunction enabled and with the appropriate security parameters by default.  Of\ncourse, It's still possible to change validation parameters, add some hooks and\nadd a validation cache too.\nThe validation cache is a way to take a fingerprint and get cached yes/no\nanswer about whether the certificate is accepted. It's a generic lookup\nmechanism, so that it could work with any storage mechanism. The same mechanism\ncan be overloaded to support Trust-on-first-use, and exceptions fingerprint\nlist.\nExceptions list a great way to use self-signed certificates without\ncompromising on security; You have to do the validation process out-of-band to\nmake sure the certificate is really the one, and then store a tuple of the name\nof the remote accessed associated with a fingerprint. The fingerprint is a\nsimple hash of the certificate, whereas the name is really just a simple\n(hostname, service) tuple.\nKey exchange methods§\n\nAlong with RSA signature, there's now DSA signature support for certificate.\nPrevious versions only supported the old RSA key exchange methods. After a bit\nof refactoring, we now have DHE-RSA and DHE-DSS support. DHE is ephemereal\nDiffie Hellman, and provide Forward Secrecy.\nIn the future, with this refactoring in place, ECDHE based key exchange methods\nand ECDSA signature will be very easy to add.\nAPI and parameters changes§\n\nThe initialization parameters for a context is now splitted into multiples smaller structures:\n\none for the supported parameters (versions, ciphers methods, compressions methods, ..)\none for shared access structures (x509 validation cache, x509 CA store, session manager, certificate and keys)\nthe client and server parameters are now 2 distinct structures. this is not anymore a common structure with a role part.\n\nAll this change allow better separation of what parameters are for the client\nand the server, and should also make it easier to setup better default, and allow\ntweaking of the configuration to be more self contain. The aim is only to have\nto set your \"Shared\" structure, and for the remaining structures uses default.\ntls-extra has been merged in tls.\nTLS Protocol Versions§\n\nPrevious tls packages were not able to downgrade protocol version. This is now completely fixed, and\nby default tls will try to use the maximum supported version (by default, TLS 1.2)\ninstead of the version specified by the user (by default, TLS 1.0).\nClient use§\n\nFor client connection, I recommend to use connection\ninstead of tls directly.\nClosing note§\n\nAnd finally this is the extents of the modifications just in tls:\n 82 files changed, 5528 insertions(+), 4568 deletions(-)\n\nEnjoy,\n","id":"https://vincenthz.github.io/announce-tls12/","title":"announcement: tls-1.2 is out"},"https://vincenthz.github.io/announcing-cryptonite/":{"body":"For the last 5 years, I've worked intermittently on cryptographic related packages for Haskell.\nLately, I've consolidated it all in one single package.

Maintenance of many cabal packages is costly in time: lower\nbounds, upper bounds, re-installation, compatibility modules, testing framework, benchmarking\nframework.\nMy limited free time has been siphoned into doing unproductive cross packages\ntasks, for example:\n\nUpgrading bounds\nSorting out ghc database of installed-packages when reinstalling packages for testing features\nDuplicating compatibility modules for supporting many compilers and library versions\nMaintaining meta data for many packages (e.g. LICENSE, CHANGELOG, README, .travis, .cabal)\nTagging and releasing new versions\n\nDoing everything in one package, simplifies the building issues, gives a better\nability to test features easily, makes a more consistent cryptographic\nsolution, and minimizes meta data changes.\nWhat happens to other crypto packages ?§\n\nCryptonite should be better in almost every aspect: better features, better testing.\nSo there are no real reasons to maintain any of the old packages anymore, so in\nthe long run, I expect most of those packages to become deprecated. I encourage\neveryone to move to the new package.\nI'll try to answer any migration questions as they arise, but most of the migration\nshould be straightforward in general.\nI'm committed to maintain cryptohash for now, as it is very widely used. I'll\ntry to maintain the rest of the packages for now, but don't expect this to last\nfor long.\nOtherwise, If some people are interested in keeping certain other pieces\nindependent and maintained, come talk to me directly with motivated arguments.\nContributing§\n\nI hope this does bring contributions, and this becomes a more\ncommunity-maintained package, and specially that cryptonite becomes the\ncanonical place for anything cryptography related in Haskell.\nMain things to look out, for successful contributions:\n\nrespect the coding style\ndo not introduce dependencies\n\nAlso you don't need to know every little thing in cryptography to help\nmaintain and add feature in cryptonite.\nPS: I'm also looking forward to more cryptography related discussions\nabout timing attacks, what source of random is truly random, etc. :-þ\n","id":"https://vincenthz.github.io/announcing-cryptonite/","title":"Announcing: cryptonite"},"https://vincenthz.github.io/cabal-db-license/":{"body":"Following discussions with fellow haskellers, regarding the need to be careful\nwith adding packages that could depends on GPL or proprietary licenses, it\nturns out it's not easy to get your dependencies's licenses listed.\n\nIt would be convenient to be able to ask the hackage database those things,\nand this is exactly what cabal-db usually works with.\ncabal-db, for the ones that\nmissed the previous\nannoucement, is a\nsimple program that using the index.tar.gz file, is able to recursively display\nor search into packages and dependencies.\nThe license subcommand is mainly to get a summary of the licenses of a packages\nand its dependencies, but it can also display the tree of licenses.

For example here we have:\n\na is at offset 0 (relative to the beginning of the structure)\nb is at offset 8\naddr.addr64 is at offset 12\naddr.addr32.hi is at offset 12\naddr.addr32.low is at offset 16\ndata is at offset 20\n\nThe size of primitives is simply the number of bits composing the type; so a\nuint64_t, composed of 64 bits is 8 bytes.  Union is a special construction\nwhere the different option in the union are overlayed on each other and the\nbiggest element define its size.  The size of a struct is defined recursively\nas the sum of all its component.\n\nfield pointed by a is size 8\nfield pointed by b is of size 4\nfield pointed by addr is size 8\nfield pointed by data is size 16\nthe whole structure is size 36\n\nWhat's wrong with Foreign§\n\nHere's the usual Foreign definition for something equivalent:\ndata Example = Example\n    { a    :: {-# UNPACK #-} !Word64\n    , b    :: {-# UNPACK #-} !Word32\n    , u    :: {-# UNPACK #-} !Word64\n    , data ::                !ByteString\n    } \n\npeekBs p ofs len = ...\n\ninstance Foreign Example\n    sizeof _ = 36\n    alignment _ = 8\n    peek p = Example &lt;$&gt; peek (castPtr p)\n                     &lt;*&gt; peek (castPtr (p `plusPtr` 8))\n                     &lt;*&gt; peek (castPtr (p `plusPtr` 12))\n                     &lt;*&gt; peekBs p 20 16\n    poke p _ = ...\n\nGiven a (valid) Ptr, we can now get element in this by creating a new Example\ntype by calling peek. This will materalize a new haskell data structure in\nthe haskell GC-managed memory which have a copy of all the fields from the Ptr.\nIn some cases, copying all this values on the haskell heap is wasteful and not\nefficient.  A simple of this use case, would be to quickly iterate over a block\nof memory to check for a few fields values repeatedly in structure.\nThe Foreign type classes and co is only about moving data between the foreign\nboundary, it's not really about efficiency dealing with this foreign boundary.\nIn short:\n\nMaterialize values on the haskell side\nNot modular: whole type peeking/poking or nothing.\nSize and alignment defined on values, not type.\nNo distinction between constant size types and variable size types.\nOften passing undefined :: SomeType to sizeof and alignment.\nUsually manually created, not typo-proof.\n\nWhat about binary parsers§\n\nThere's many binary parser on the market: binary\n, cereal, packer,\nstore.\nMost of a binary parser job is taking a stream of bytes and efficiently turning\nthose bytes into haskell value. One added job is dealing with chunking, since\nyou may not have all the memory for parsing, you need to deal with values that\nare cut between memory boundaries and have to deal with resumption.\nHere's an example of a binary parser for example:\ngetExample :: Get Example\ngetExample =\n    Example &lt;$&gt; getWord64Host\n            &lt;*&gt; getWord32Host\n            &lt;*&gt; getWord64Host\n            &lt;*&gt; getByteString 16\n\nHowever, intuitively this has the exact same problem as Foreign, you can't\nselectively and modularly deal with the data, and this create also\nfull copy of the data on the haskell side. This is clearly warranted when\ndealing with memory that you want processed in chunks, since you\ncan't hold on to the data stream to refer to it later.\nDefining a C structure in haskell§\n\nDealing with memory directly is error prone and it would be nice to able\nto simulate C structures overlay on memory without having to deal with\nsize, offset and composition manually and to remain as efficient as possible.\nFirst we're gonna need a recent GHC (at least 8.0) and the following extensions:\n{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE UndecidableInstances #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}\n{-# LANGUAGE AllowAmbiguousTypes #-}\n\nThen the following imports:\nimport GHC.TypeLits\nimport Data.Type.Bool\nimport Data.Proxy\nimport Data.Int\nimport Data.Word\n\nWe define a simple ADT of all the possible elements that you can find, and their compositions:\ndata Element =\n      FInt8\n    | FWord8\n    | FInt16\n    | FWord16\n    | FInt32\n    | FWord32\n    | FInt64\n    | FWord64\n    | FFloat\n    | FDouble\n    | FLong\n    | FArray Nat Element          -- size of the element and type of element\n    | FStruct [(Symbol, Element)] -- list of of field * type\n    | FUnion [(Symbol, Element)]  -- list of field * type\n\nnow struct example can be represented with:\ntype Example = 'FStruct\n    '[ '( \"a\"   , 'FWord64)\n     , '( \"b\"   , 'FWord32)\n     , '( \"addr\", 'FUnion '[ '( \"addr64\", 'FWord64)\n                           , '( \"addr32\", 'FStruct '[ '( \"hi\", 'FWord32)\n                                                    , '( \"low\", 'FWord32) ])\n                           ])\n     , '( \"data\", 'FArray 16 'FWord8 )\n     ]\n\nCalculating sizes§\n\nSize is one of the key thing we need to be able to do on element.\nUsing a type family we can define the Size type which take an Element and returns a Nat\nrepresenting the size of the element. \ntype family Size (t :: Element) where\n\nThis is very easy for our primitives types:\n    Size ('FInt8)       = 1\n    Size ('FWord8)      = 1\n    Size ('FInt16)      = 2\n    Size ('FWord16)     = 2\n    Size ('FInt32)      = 4\n    Size ('FWord32)     = 4\n    Size ('FInt64)      = 8\n    Size ('FWord64)     = 8\n    Size ('FFloat)      = 4\n    Size ('FDouble)     = 8\n    Size ('FLong)       = 8 -- hardcoded for example sake, but would be dynamic in real code\n\nThe array is simply the Size of the element multiplied by the number of elements:\n    Size ('FArray n el) = n * Size el\n\nFor the constructed elements, we need to define extra recursive type families.\nThe structure is recursively defined to be the sum of its component Size, and\nthe union is recursively defined as the biggest element in it,.\n    Size ('FStruct ls)  = StructSize ls\n    Size ('FUnion ls)   = UnionSize ls\n\ntype family StructSize (ls :: [(Symbol, Element)]) where\n    StructSize '[]            = 0\n    StructSize ('(_,l) ': ls) = Size l + StructSize ls\n\ntype family UnionSize (ls :: [(Symbol, Element)]) where\n    UnionSize '[] = 0\n    UnionSize ('(_,l) ': ls) = If (Size l &lt;=? UnionSize ls) (UnionSize ls) (Size l)\n\nAlmost there, we only need a way to materialize the Size type, to have a\nvalue that we can use in our haskell code:\ngetSize :: forall el . KnownNat (Size el) =&gt; Integer\ngetSize = natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (Size el))\n\nThis looks a bit magic, so let's decompose this to make clear what happens;\nfirst getSize is a constant Integer, it doesn't have any parameters. Next\nthe el type variable represent the type that we want to know the size of,\nand the contraint on el is that applying the Size type function, we\nhave a KnownNat (Known Natural). In the body of the constant function we use\nnatVal that takes a Proxy of a KnownNat to materialize the value.\nGiven this signature, despite being a constant value, getSize need to determine\nthe element on which it is applied. We can use the Type Application to effectively\nforce the el element to be what we want to resolve to:\n&gt; putStrLn $ show (getSize @Example)\n36\n\nZooming with accessors§\n\nOne first thing we need to have an accessor types to represent how we represent\npart of data structures.  For example in C, given the struct example, we want\nto be able to do:\n    .a\n    .addr.addr32.hi\n    .data[3]\n    .data\n\nin a case of a structure or a union, we use the field name to dereference the structure,\nbut in case of an array, we use an integral index. This is really straighforward:\ndata Access = Field Symbol | Index Nat\n\nA List of Access would represent the zooming inside the data structures. The previous\nexample can be written in haskell with:\n    '[ 'Field \"a\" ]\n    '[ 'Field \"addr\", 'Field \"addr32\", 'Field \"hi\" ]\n    '[ 'Field \"data\", 'Index 3 ]\n    '[ 'Field \"data\" ]\n\nCalculating Offset§\n\nOffset of fields is the next important step to have full capabilities in this system\nWe define a type family for this that given an Element and [Access] would get back an offset in Nat.\nNote that due to the recurvise approach we add the offset ofs to start from.\ntype family Offset (ofs :: Nat) (accessors :: [Access]) (t :: Element) where\n\nWhen the list of accessors is empty, we have reach the element, so we can just return the offset we have calculated\n    Offset ofs '[]          t                = ofs\n\nWhen we have a non empty list we call to each respective data structure with:\n\nthe current offset\nthe name of field searched or the index searched\neither the dictionary of symbol to element (represented by '[(Symbol, Element)]) or the array size and inner Element\n\n    Offset ofs ('Field f:fs) ('FStruct dict) = StructOffset ofs f fs dict\n    Offset ofs ('Field f:fs) ('FUnion dict)  = UnionOffset ofs f fs dict\n    Offset ofs ('Index i:fs) ('FArray n t)   = ArrayOffset ofs i fs n t\n\nBeing a type enforced definition, it also mean that with this you can mix up\ntrying to Index into a Structure, or trying to dereference a Field into an\nArray. the type system will (too) emphatically complain.\nBoth the Structure and Union will recursely match in the dictionary of symbol to find\na matching field. If we reach the empty list, we haven't found the right field\nand the developper is notified with a friendly TypeError, at compilation time, that the field is\nnot present in the structure.\nEach time an field is skipped in the structure the size of the element being skipped, is added to the current offset.\ntype family StructOffset (ofs :: Nat)\n                         (field :: Symbol)\n                         (rs :: [Access])\n                         (dict :: [(Symbol, Element)]) where\n    StructOffset ofs field rs '[]                =\n        TypeError ('Text \"offset: field \"\n             ':&lt;&gt;: 'ShowType field\n             ':&lt;&gt;: 'Text \" not found in structure\")\n    StructOffset ofs field rs ('(field, t) ': _) = Offset ofs rs t\n    StructOffset ofs field rs ('(_    , v) ': r) = StructOffset (ofs + Size v) field rs r\n\ntype family UnionOffset (ofs :: Nat)\n                        (field :: Symbo)\n                        (rs :: [Access])\n                        (dict :: [(Symbol, Element)]) where\n    UnionOffset ofs field rs '[]                 =\n        TypeError ('Text \"offset: field \"\n             ':&lt;&gt;: 'ShowType field\n             ':&lt;&gt;: 'Text \" not found in union\")\n    UnionOffset ofs field rs ('(field, t) ': _)  = Offset ofs rs t\n    UnionOffset ofs field rs (_            : r)  = UnionOffset ofs field rs r\n\nIn the case of the array, we can just make sure, at compilation time, that the user is accessing\na field that is within bounds, otherwise we also notify the developer with a friendly TypeError.\ntype family ArrayOffset (ofs :: Nat)\n                        (idx :: Nat)\n                        (rs :: [Access])\n                        (n :: Nat)\n                        (t :: Element) where\n    ArrayOffset ofs idx rs n t =\n        If (n &lt;=? idx)\n            (TypeError ('Text \"out of bounds : index is \"\n                  ':&lt;&gt;: 'ShowType idx\n                  ':&lt;&gt;: 'Text \" but array of size \"\n                  ':&lt;&gt;: 'ShowType n))\n            (Offset (ofs + (idx * Size t)) rs t)\n\nA simple example of how the machinery works:\n&gt; Offset ofs '[ 'Field \"data\", 'Index 2 ]) Example\n&gt; StructOffset ofs \"data\" ['Index 2 ]\n               '[ '(\"a\", ..), '(\"b\", ..) , '(\"addr\", ..), '( \"data\", ..) ]\n&gt; StructOffset (ofs + Size 'Word64) \"data\" ['Index 2]\n               '[ '(\"b\", ..) , '(\"addr\", ..), '( \"data\", ..) ]\n&gt; StructOffset (ofs + 8 + Size 'Word32) \"data\" ['Index 2]\n               '[ '(\"addr\", ..), '( \"data\", ..) ]\n&gt; StructOffset (ofs + 12 + Size ('Union ..)) \"data\" ['Index 2 ]\n               '[ '( \"data\", 'Farray 16 'FWord8) ]\n&gt; Offset (ofs + 20) ['Index 3] ('FArray 16 'FWord8)\n&gt; Offset (ofs + 20 + 3 * Size 'FWord8) [] 'FWord8\n&gt; ofs + 23\n\nNow we can just calculate Offset of accessors in structure, we just need something to use it.\ngetOffset :: forall el fields . (KnownNat (Offset 0 fields el)) =&gt; Integer\ngetOffset = natVal (Proxy :: Proxy (Offset 0 fields el))\n\nAgain same magic as getSize, and we also define a constant by construction.\nWe also start counting the offset at 0 since we want to calculate absolute\ndisplacement, but we could start at some other points depending on need, and\nprevent a runtime addition if we were to know the starting offset at compilation\nfor example.\n&gt; putStrLn $ show (getOffset @Example @('[])\n0\n&gt; putStrLn $ show (getOffset @Example @('[ 'Field \"a\"]))\n0\n&gt; putStrLn $ show (getOffset @Example @('[ 'Field \"b\"]))\n8\n&gt; putStrLn $ show (getOffset @Example @('[ 'Field \"addr, 'Index \"addr32\", 'Field \"lo\" \"]))\n16\n&gt; putStrLn $ show (getOffset @Example @('[ 'Field \"data, 'Index 3 ]))\n23\n\nConclusion§\n\nOne nice aspect on this is that you can efficiently nest structure, and you can\nwithout a problem re-use the same field names for structure.\nYou can also define at compilation all sorts of different offsets and sizes\nthat automatically recalculate given their structures, and combine together.\nWith this primitive machinery, it's straighforward to define an efficient,\nsafe, modular accessors (e.g. peek &amp; poke) functions on top of this.\nCode§\n\nYou can find the code:\n\nCode Gist\nExperimental Example Usage Gist\n\nNotes§\n\n\nPacking &amp; Padding\n\nIn all this code I consider the C structure packed, and not containing any\npadding. While the rules of alignment/padding could be added to the calculation\ntypes, I chose to ignore the issue since the developper can always from a\npacked structure definition, add the necessary padding explicitely in the\ndefinition.  It would also be possible to define special padding types that\nautomatically work out their size given how much padding is needed.\n\nEndianness\n\nI completely ignore endianness for simplicity purpose, but a real library would\nlikely and simply extend the definitions to add explicit endianness for all\nmulti-bytes types.\n\nNat and Integer\n\nIt would be nice to be able to generate offset in machine Int or Word, instead\nof unbounded Integer.  Sadly the only capability for Nat is to generate Integer\nwith natVal.  The optimisation is probably marginal considering it's just a\nconstructor away, but it would prevent an unnecessary unwrapping and possibly\neven more efficient code.\n","id":"https://vincenthz.github.io/compilation-cstruct/","title":"Efficient CStruct"},"https://vincenthz.github.io/cryptoxide-performance/":{"body":"Related to some engine rewrite and SSE, AVX, AVX2 cpu optimisation I did last\nyear on cryptoxide :\n\nSHA2 optimisation\nBlake2 optimisation\n\nHistory of cryptoxide§\n\nCryptoxide is a fork of the initial rust-crypto\none-stop cryptography package that went unmaintained.\nIn 2018, we needed a pure rust version to construct rust-wasm based\nweb-applications when this use case was in its infancy; rust-crypto was an\ninteresting starting point, as all the algorithms were written in pure rust,\nand it was also easier to construct something than the exploded version which\nwould have required lots more time to port.\nMany other cryptographic packages are now wasm friendly also.\nBenchmarks setup§\n\n\ncpu: 3.6 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 (I9-9900K)\nrust compiler: stable 1.49\ncryptoxide: 0.3.0\nrust-crypto: blake2 0.9.1, sha2 0.9.1\nring: 0.16.19\n\nThe benchmark code itself consist of benchmarking few time the main costly\npart of each algorithm over a 10 megabytes array and taking the average of\nthe run.

Foundation is a new library that tries to define a new modern Haskell framework.\nIt is also trying to be more than a library: A common place for\nthe community to improve things and define new things\n\nIt started as a thought experiment:\nWhat would a modern Haskell base looks like if I could start from scratch ?\nWhat would I need to complete my Haskell projects without\nfalling into traditional pitfalls like inefficient String, all-in-one Num,\nun-productive packing and unpacking, etc.\nOne of the constraints, that was set early on, was not depending on any\nexternal packages, instead depending only on what GHC provides (itself, base, and libraries like ghc-prim).\nWhile it may sound surprising, especially considering the usually high quality and precision of\nlibraries available on hackage, there are many reasons for not depending on anything;\nI’ll motivate the reason later in the article, so hang on.\nA very interesting article from Stephen Diehl on production, that details\nwell some of the pitfalls of Haskell, or the workaround for less than\nideal situation/choice, outline pretty well some of the reasons for this effort.\nStarting with the basic§\n\nOne of the few basic things that you'll find in any modern haskell project, is\nByteArray, Array and packed strings.  Usually in the form of the bytestring,\nvector and text packages.\nWe decided to start here. One of the common problem of those types is\ntheir lack of inter-operability.  There's usually a way to convert one into\nanother, but it's either exposed in an Unsafe or Internal module, or has a\nscary name like unsafeFromForeignPtr.\nThen, if you're unlucky you will see some issues with unpinned and pinned\n(probably in production settings to maximise fun); the common ByteString using\nthe pinned memory, ShortByteString and Text using unpinned memory, and\nVector, well, it's complicated (there's 4 different kind of Vectors).\nNote: pinned and unpinned represent whether the memory is allowed to move by\nthe GC. Unpinned usually is better as it allows the memory system to reduce\nfragmentation, but pinned memory is crucial for dealing with Input/Output with\nthe real world, large data (and some other uses).\nUnboxed Array§\n\nOur corner stone is the unboxed array. The unboxed array is a native Haskell\nByteArray (represented by the ByteArray# primitive type),\nand it is allowed to be unpinned or pinned (at allocation time). To also support\nfurther interesting stuff, we supplement it with another constructor to make it\nable to support natively a chunk of memory referenced by a pointer.\nIn simplified terms it looks like:\ndata UArray ty = UArrayBA (Offset ty) (Size ty) PinnedStatus ByteArray#\n               | UArrayAddr (Offset ty) (Size ty) (Ptr ty)\n\nWith this capability, we have the equivalent of ByteString,\nShortByteString, Unboxed Vector and (Some) Storable Vector,  implemented\nin one user friendly type. This is a really big win for users, as suddenly all\nthose types play better together; they are all the same thing working\nthe same way.\nInstead of differentiating ByteString and Vector, now ByteString disappears\ncompletely in favor of just being a UArray Word8. This has been tried\nbefore with the current ecosystem with vector-bytestring.\nString§\n\nString is a big pain point. Base represents it as a list of Char [Char], which\nas you can imagine is not efficient for most purpose. Text from the popular text\npackage implements a packed version of this, using UTF-16 and unpinned native ByteArray#.\nWhile text is almost a standard in haskell, it’s very likely you’ll need\nto pack and unpack this representation to interact with base functions, or\nswitch representation often to interact with some libraries.\nNote on Unicode: UTF-8 is an encoding format where unicode codepoints are\nencoded in sequence of 1 to 4 bytes (4 different cases). UTF-16 represent unicode\nsequences with either 2 or 4 bytes (2 different cases).\nFoundation’s String are packed UTF-8 data backed by an unboxed vector of bytes.\nThis means we can offer a lightweight type based on UArray Word8:\nnewtype String = String (UArray Word8)\n\nSo by doing this, we inherit directly all the advantages of our vector types; namely\nwe have a String type that is unpinned or pinned (depending on needs), and supports\nnative pointers. It is extremely lightweight to convert between the two: provided\nUTF8 binary data, we only validate the data, without re-allocating anything.\nThere’s no perfect representation of unicode; each representation has it own\nadvantages and disadvantages, and it really depends on what types of data you’re\nactually processing. One of the easy rules of thumb is that the more your representation\nhas cases, the slower it will be to process the highest unicode sequences.\nBy extension, it means that choosing a unique representation leads to compromise.\nIn early benchmarks against text we are consistently outperforming Text when\nthe data is predominantly ASCII (i.e. 1-byte encoding).\nIn other type of data, it really depends; sometimes we’re faster still,\nsometimes slower, and sometimes par.\nCaveat emptor: benchmarks are far from reliable, and only been run on 2 machines\nwith similar characteristic so far.\nOther Types§\n\nWe also support already:\n\nBoxed Array. This is an array to any other Haskell types. Think of it as\narray of pointers to another Haskell value\nBitmap. 1 bit packed unboxed array\n\nIn the short term, we expect to add:\n\ntree like structure.\nhash based structure.\n\nUnified Collection API§\n\nMany types of collections support the same kind of operations.\nFor example, commonly you have very similar functions defined with different types:\n    take :: Int -&gt; UArray a -&gt; UArray a\n    take :: Int -&gt; [a]      -&gt; [a]\n    take :: Int -&gt; String   -&gt; String\n\n    head :: UArray a -&gt; a\n    head :: String   -&gt; Char\n    head :: [a]      -&gt; a\n\nSo we tried to avoid monomorphic versions of common Haskell functions and instead\nprovide type family infused versions of those functions. In foundation we have:\n    take :: Int -&gt; collection -&gt; collection\n\n    head :: collection -&gt; Element collection\n\n\nNote: Element collection is a type family. this allow from a type \"collection\"\nto define another type. for example, the Element of a [a] is a, and the Element of\nString is Char.\nNote2: head is not exactly defined this way in foundation: This was the simplest example\nthat show Type families in action and the overloading. foundation's head is not partial and defined:\nhead :: NonEmpty collection -&gt; Element collection\nThe consequence is that the same head or take (or other generic functions) works\nthe same way for many different collection types, even when they are monomorphic (e.g. String).\nFor another good example of this approach being taken, have a look at the\nmono-traversable package\nFor other operations that are specific to a data structure, and hard to generalize,\nwe still expose dedicated operations.\nThe question of dependencies§\n\nIf you’re not convinced by how we provide a better foundation to the standard\nHaskell types, then it raises the question: why not depend\non those high quality libraries doing the exact same thing ?\nConsistency. I think it's easier to set a common direction, and have a consistent\napproach when working in a central place together, than having N maintainers\nworking on M packages independently.\nCommon place. An example speaks better than words sometime: I have this X thing,\nthat depends on the A package, and the B package. Should I add it to A, to B, or\ncreate a new C package ?\nAtomic development. We don't have to jump through hoops to improve our types\nor functions against other part of foundation. Having more things defined in a\nsame place, means we can be more aggressive about improving things faster,\nwhile retaining an overall package that make sense.\nVersions, and Releases. Far easier to depends on a small set of library\nthan depends on hundreds of different versions. Particularly in an industrial\nsettings, I will be much more confident tracking 1 package, watch 1 issue tracker\nand deal with a set of known people, than having to deal with N packages, N issues trackers\n(possibly in different places), and N maintainers.\nSome final notes§\n\nA fast iterative release schedule. Planning to release early, release often.\nand with a predictable release schedule.\nWe're still in the early stage. While we're at an exciting place,\ndon't expect a finish product right now.\nYou don't need to be an expert to help. anyone can help us shape foundation.\nJoin us.

The stated goal of rust are: \"a systems programming language focused\non three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency\". Combining Rust with Haskell\ncould create some interesting use cases, and could replace use of C in some\nprojects while providing a more high level and safer approach where Haskell\ncannot be used.\n\nOne of my reason for doing this, is that writing code targetting low-level\nfeatures is simpler in Rust than Haskell. For example, writing inline assembly\nor some lowlevel OS routines. Also the performance of Rust is quite close to\nC++, and I could see this being useful in certain case where Haskell is not as\noptimised.\nIn this short tutorial, let's call Rust functions from Haskell.\nThe Rust library§\n\nFirst we start with an hypothetical rust library that takes a value, print to\nconsole and return a value.\nOur entry point in Rust is a simple rust_hello, in a src/lib.rs file:\n#[no_mangle]\npub extern fn rust_hello(v: i32) -&gt; i32 {\n    println!(\"Hello Rust World: {}\", v);\n    v+1\n} \n\nOne of the key thing here is the presence of the no_mangle pragma, that allow\nexporting the name of the function as-is in the library we're going to generate.\nRust uses Cargo to package library and executable, akin to Cabal for haskell.\nWe can create the Cargo.toml for our test library:\n[package]\nname = \"hello\"\nversion = \"0.0.1\"\nauthors = [\"Vincent Hanquez &lt;vincent@snarc.org&gt;\"]\n\n[lib]\nname = \"hello\"\ncrate-type = [\"staticlib\"]\n\nThe only special trick is that we ask Cargo to build a static library in the\ncrate-type section, instead of the default rust lib (.rlib).\nHaskell doesn't know other calling / linking convention like C++ (yet) or\nRust, which is why we need to go through those hoops.\nWe can now build with our Rust library with:\ncargo build\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, you should end up with a target directory where you can find the libhello.a library.\nThe haskell part§\n\nNow the haskell part is really easy, as this point there's no much difference\nthan linking with some static C library; first we create a src/Main.hs:\n{-# LANGUAGE ForeignFunctionInterface #-}\nmodule Main where\n\nimport Foreign.C.Types\n\nforeign import ccall unsafe \"rust_hello\" rust_hello :: CInt -&gt; IO CInt\n\nmain = do\n    v &lt;- rust_hello 1234\n    putStrLn (\"Rust returned: \" ++ show v)\n\nNothing special if you've done some C bindings yourself, otherwise I suggest\nhaving a look at the FFI article.\nwe can try directly linking with ghc:\nghc -o hello-rust --make src/Main.hs -lhello -Ltarget/debug\n\nand running:\n$ ./hello-rust\nHello Rust World: 1234\nRust returned: 1235\n\nThat achieve the goal above.

It can also create some confusion,\nand print a warning on my system when one of the directory is missing.\nThe missing step is either adding some pre-build rules to cabal Setup.hs to run cargo build, or\nsome more elaborate build system, both which are left as exercice to the interested reader.\nWhere this could go§\n\nGoing forward, this could lead to having another language from Haskell to\ntarget that is not as lowlevel as C, but offer stellar performance and more\nhigh level constructs (than C) without imposing any other runtime system.

The main syscall is mmap, but there's also some others syscalls in the\nsame family to handle mapped memories like mlock, munlock, mprotect, madvise,\nmsync.\n\nSome limited mmap access is available through the\nmmap or\nbytestring-mmap packages,\nbut both provide a high level access to those API.\nTo the rescue, I've released\nunix-memory.  This provide\nlow level access to all those syscalls. In some place, the API presented is\nslightly better than the raw API.\nThis package is supposed to be ephemeral; The goal is to fold this package to\nthe venerable unix package when this\nbecomes less experimental, more stable and is known to work on different\nunixoid platforms.  If and when this happens, then this package will just\nprovide compatibility for old versions and eventually be deprecated.\nManipulating memory is unsafe in general, so don't expect any safety from this\npackage, by design. Also if you don't know what you're doing, don't use those\nAPIs; It's difficult to get right.\nBut it also allow interesting patterns when you cooperate with the operating system\nto efficiently map files, and devices as virtual memory.\nA simple example opening the \"/dev/zero\" device first memory page, and reading 4096 bytes from it:\nimport System.Posix.IO\nimport System.Posix.Memory\nimport Control.Monad\nimport Control.Exception (bracket)\nimport Foreign.C.Types\nimport Foreign.Storable\n\nbracket (openFd \"/dev/zero\" ReadWrite Nothing defaultFileFlags) closeFd $ \\fd -&gt;\n  bracket (memoryMap Nothing 4096 [MemoryProtectionRead] MemoryMapPrivate (Just fd) 0)\n          (\\mem -&gt; memoryUnmap mem 4096)\n          (\\mem -&gt; mapM (peekElemOff mem) [0..4095])\n\n","id":"https://vincenthz.github.io/unix-memory/","title":"unix memory"}},"docInfo":{"https://vincenthz.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://vincenthz.github.io/about/":{"body":121,"title":0},"https://vincenthz.github.io/announce-tls12/":{"body":546,"title":4},"https://vincenthz.github.io/announcing-cryptonite/":{"body":358,"title":2},"https://vincenthz.github.io/cabal-db-license/":{"body":130,"title":4},"https://vincenthz.github.io/cabal-db/":{"body":427,"title":7},"https://vincenthz.github.io/compilation-cstruct/":{"body":1467,"title":2},"https://vincenthz.github.io/cryptoxide-performance/":{"body":334,"title":4},"https://vincenthz.github.io/downloading-safely/":{"body":316,"title":2},"https://vincenthz.github.io/foundation/":{"body":856,"title":1},"https://vincenthz.github.io/ghc-core-html/":{"body":96,"title":3},"https://vincenthz.github.io/ghc-stack/":{"body":266,"title":4},"https://vincenthz.github.io/haskell-crypto-platform/":{"body":339,"title":3},"https://vincenthz.github.io/hourglass-simpler-time/":{"body":727,"title":3},"https://vincenthz.github.io/ouroboros-vrf-explanation/":{"body":397,"title":4},"https://vincenthz.github.io/rust-with-haskell/":{"body":449,"title":3},"https://vincenthz.github.io/unix-memory/":{"body":169,"title":2}},"length":17},"lang":"English"};
